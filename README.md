# SimpleNameGenerator
A simple fantasy name generator. And I mean very simple... Plain JavaScript, no bells and whistles. It was originally intended as a minor component of my other project, Monbot.py, where a Python-equivalent is used to generate NPC names.
I've decided to make it a tiny, convenient webpage should I ever want or need randomly-generated names for world-building.
