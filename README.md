# SimpleNameGenerator
A simple fantasy name generator. And I mean very simple. It was originally intended as a minor component of my other project, Monbot, where it is used to generate NPC names.
I've decided to make it a tiny, convenient webpage should I ever need randomly-generated names for world-building.

You can view the deployment at: <https://hammerlord.github.io/SimpleNameGenerator/>.
